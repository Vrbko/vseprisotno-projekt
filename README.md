# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide before proceeding.
## Versions
```
ios: 18.4 (simulator)
react-native --version: 18.0.0
react-native-cli: 2.0.1
react-native: 0.79.1

Important:
    react-native-maps: ^1.20.1
    react-native-vector-icons: ^9.2.0
```
## Step 1: NPM/YARN

First, you will need to run **Metro**, the JavaScript build tool for React Native.

To start the Metro dev server, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

```sh
# Using npm
npm install
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn install
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Build and run your app

With Metro running, open a new terminal window/pane from the root of your React Native project, and use one of the following commands to build and run your Android or iOS app:


### iOS

For iOS, remember to install CocoaPods dependencies (this only needs to be run on first clone or after updating native deps).

The first time you create a new project, run the Ruby bundler to install CocoaPods itself:

```sh
bundle install
```

Then, and every time you update your native dependencies, run:
```sh
cd ios
pod install 
cd ..
```


For more information, please visit [CocoaPods Getting Started guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).



Running
```sh
# using npx
npx react-native run-ios

# OR using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in the Android Emulator, iOS Simulator, or your connected device.
